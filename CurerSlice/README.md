# CurerSlice/print.wow

- This print.wow is a forged .wow file that puts the LCD in pass-through, switches on the UV for one hour and that's all. Basically, it turns the Sparkmaker into a UV print curer.
- While I think it is reasonably safe, PLEASE take the following warnings into consideration and bear them in mind:
    - WARNING : Use at your own risks.
    - WARNING : Be careful not to damage your eyes & skin! Put on the lid!
    - WARNING : This is not really specific to this, but keep in mind that : IPA/Ethanol + heat source = fire
    - WARNING : This could cause early wear of the LCD screen (maybe?). If you fear that, remove the LCD or don't use...

# USAGE

1. Copy print.wow into your SD card.
2. Remove the vat from Sparkmaker.
3. (Optional) remove LCD. (note: I didn't, I don't know if it works)
4. To protect the transparent surface from resin, you could put something transparent to UV over the transparent surface. If you do, be careful it is not something that could burn.
5. Put your WASHED print over that.
6. Put lid on Sparkmaker.
7. Put SD card into Sparkmaker.
8. Power Sparkmaker on.
9. Press button.
10. Wait as you see fit.
11. Power Sparkmaker off.
12. Remove lid.
13. Take print out.

# CUSTOMIZING

If, for some reason, you want more than 1 hour of UV, or, conversely, if you want the thing to turn off earlier, you could edit and run the python file in the parent folder to re-generate the file, adapted to your needs.
